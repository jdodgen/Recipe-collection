Chuck's Stuffed Poblano Chilies: Chuck Dodgen
some of Brother Jim's modifications 2023,2024

Ingredients: 
Poblano chilies (one per person, find large ones, or two small ones)
Soy Chorizo(~1/3 stick per chili, 1/2 for big ones) I use the soy version, less grease  
Cheese (any cheese will do) I use a mexican blend or queso quesadilla 
cheap brown rice 

Directions:
Cook the rice (in chicken broth is nice, but not required)

Put poblano's in ziplock bag with a little water and microwave on low power ~3 minutes or until soft
Then let them steam some more in the bag after they come out.

cut stem from poblano, toward the top, scrape seeds, scrape most of the interior ribs.
save the stem to plug it back

Mix cheese and the Chorizo in a bowl about 70% Chorizo to 30% cheese.

Stuff the chilies

Place the stem back to plug the hole, "sort of" :)

bake until at least 160F at 375F should be about ~30 minutes

Serve chilies on the bed of rice.
