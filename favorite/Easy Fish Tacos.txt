Easy Fish Tacos

Ingredients  
For the fish:
1 pound white fish filets, # JED about 1.3 oz per taco 
2 to 3 teaspoons chili powder, enough to coat the fish
1 teaspoon kosher salt

For the fish taco sauce:
1/2 cup sour cream
1/4 cup mayonnaise
3 to 4 tablespoons lime juice
1 teaspoon or more of thin hot sauce

To assemble:
1/2 shredded cabbage (about 6 cups)
4 radishes, thinly sliced
4 spring/green onions, thinly sliced
1/3 cup roughly chopped cilantro

tortillas: 12 "street taco" size (4 or 5 inches in diameter). Adjust for larger


Method
Make the fish taco sauce:
In a small bowl, combine the sour cream, mayonnaise, lime juice, and hot sauce 
for the taco sauce. Stir until combined.

Make the cabbage slaw:
In a medium bowl, combine the shredded cabbage with 3 tablespoons of the fish taco sauce. 
Stir to coat and add more sauce if you need. A very thin coating preferred.

Season the fish:
Sprinkle the fish on both sides with chili powder and salt. Gently rub in the seasonings with your fingers to make sure the fish is entirely coated.

Warm the tortillas while cooking the fish or before:

Cook the fish:
Warm a nonstick skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat. When hot, add a couple of 
tablespoons of olive or other oil and tilt the pan to entirely coat the bottom.

Add the fish to the pan and cook and flip.

Use a fork or a knife to gently break the fish into chunks. 

Assemble the tacos with a few pieces of fish, some cabbage slaw, 
toppings of your choice, and a drizzle of the fish taco sauce.
