Jim's Chex mix 

2 cups Corn Chex™ cereal
2 cups Rice Chex™ cereal (I usualy Leave this out and make 3 cups of the others)
2 cups Wheat Chex™ cereal
1.5 cup peanuts or other nuts or seeds
1 cup (aprox) pretzel crisps crunched up or small prezels 


1 stick butter (4oz+) 
1/3 cup  Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoons salt
1/8 cup garlic powder
1/8 cup onion powder
1 tbls Chipotle powder or other chili powder (New Mex prefered)

Pre heat oven to ~250°F. 
In large bowl, mix cereals & prezels. 
In another bowl melt the butter, and mix in the other ingredients (including peanuts, except the chex & prezels).

Pour the butter mixture over the chex mixture and toss to get it all well coated.
Place on/in a sheet and put in a 250F oven stiring about every 15 minutes for 40+ minutes, 
don't let it burn, you are just drying it out.
