## original posting 1994 
I posted this to a newsgroup back in 1994. After working for a while in the UK and wanting
to make salsa I discovered that cilantro (fresh corriander) was not sold in
the large bunches as in SoCal. But was in a small package for fresh herbs.  
So when I returned home I actualy counted the number of stems/sprigs in my "bunch" of cilantro.
