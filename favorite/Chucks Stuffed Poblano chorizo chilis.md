# Chuck's Stuffed Poblano Chilies: Chuck Dodgen
## Brother Jim's modifications 2023,2024

```
Ingredients for two:
mesurments are all just guidelines  
2 Poblano chilies (one per person, find large ones, or 3 or 4  small ones)
1 stick Chorizo(~1/3 stick per chili, 1/2 for big ones) I use the soy version, less grease  
8 oz or more Cheese (any cheese will do) I use a mexican blend or queso quesadilla 
1.5 cups cheap brown rice.
1 can chicken broth (optional) 

Directions:
Cook the rice in chicken broth or water. I use a "instant pot"/pressure cooker.
One 15oz can broth to 1.5 cups of med brown rice with a little water.

Put poblano's in ziplock bag with a little water and microwave on low power ~3 minutes or until soft
Then let them steam some more in the bag after they come out.

cut stem from poblano, toward the top, scrape seeds, scrape most of the interior ribs.
save the stem to plug it back

Mix cheese and the Chorizo in a bowl about 70% Chorizo to 30% cheese.

Stuff the chilies

Place the stem back to plug the hole, "sort of" :)

bake until at least 160F internal at 375F should be done in about ~30 minutes

Serve chilies on a bed of rice.
