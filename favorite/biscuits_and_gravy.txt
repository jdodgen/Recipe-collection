Fry up the sausage in a large frying pan, break up into little bits. 
add the Shortening and stir in. now stir in the flour. 
add milk (about 1/2 quart) and cook or thin until it is a nice gravy thickness. 
Serve on biscuits add some salt and a bunch of pepper. 
A scrambled egg on the top is a nice touch.

This recipe was made when at Jan Anderson's house
Art Anderson and I worked togehrt at TRW andI would on occasion
go to his place to help him with computer stuff. 
Jan always made me the above which was wonderfull.
One time I wanted the recipe and Jan said she "made it from memory"
So the next time I was there we measured things out and came up with the above.
