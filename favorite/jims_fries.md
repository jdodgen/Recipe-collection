## you need
 - Potatoes, russets work good. you need starchy.

 - oil. I prefer grapeseed oil, or any oil that can take th heat will work.
 - bowls
 - pans
## Process
Four steps Slicing, Soaking, Par-frying, and Crisping.
1. Slicing: cube size of about 15-20mm or around 5/8 inch works nice.
2. Soaking: Soak them for 30 minutes
3. par-frying: cooking At around 200F/95C. Cook until they are starting to fall apart. Move to a pan to cool and drain for about an hour.
4. Crisping: Hot oil 375F or 190C. Cook in small batches to avoid tempature drops and soggy fries. You want them to fry up pretty quick. Serve and eat imediately... like they came from a stand in Rotterdam.
