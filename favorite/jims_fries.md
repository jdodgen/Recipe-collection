## Process
Four steps Slicing, Soaking, Par-frying, and Crisping.
1. <b>Slicing</b>: cube size of about 15mm or around 9/16 inch works nice.
2. <b>Soaking</b>: Soak them for 30 minutes
3. <b>par-frying</b> cooking At around 200F/95C. Cook until they are starting to fall apart. Move to a pan to cool and drain for about an hour or more.
4. <b>Crisping</b>: Hot oil 375F or 190C. Cook in small batches to avoid tempature drops and soggy fries. You want them to fry up pretty quick. Serve and eat imediately... like they came from a stand in Rotterdam.   
   
## Dipping
 - Mayonase: The Dutch Mayo or frietsaus , is a little different than the normal US Mayo. I find miracle whip thinned with a little water comes close.   
- Utah fry sauce: Made famouse by "Artic Circle" hamburger stands.   1 part mayo, 2/3 part ketchup, a little dill pickle juice, tiny amout of cayanne peper.    
- Tomato ketchup: out of the jar
