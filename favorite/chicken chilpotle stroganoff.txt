Jim's Chicken Chilpotle Stroganoff

I hardly ever measure so all these are approximate.

1 lb of rice (brown or white)
3 large onions
1 7.5 oz can of chilpotle peppers (in adobo sauce)
2 pints of sour cream
1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts
fresh cilantro
adobo seasoning powder (make your own: "Adobo Spice Blend.txt")
oil

 

Cook the rice according to directions. I use a rice cooker which makes it very simple.

Slice the chicken breasts about 1/4 inch strips. sprinkle on a little Adobo. set aside.

Use 1/2 or more of the Chilpotle peppers and some of the sauce. chop up fine. set aside.

on a clean cutting board and a clean knife chop the cilantro, set aside.

Slice the onions very thin. In a large fry pan or wok, heat about 2-3 tbsp of oil, and
fry the onions until brown and well caramelized. remove ad set aside. leave as much of
the oil behind as you can. If during this step the onions are sticking feel free to
add a little more oil.
 
In a large fry pan or wok, using the oil left behind from the onion fry, add the chicken
and stir fry until done. again if more oil is needed feel free.

Add the onions back to the pan with the chicken. continue stirring. toss in the chopped
chilpotle peppers with the sauce.

NOTE:
Any of the steps up to this point could be interrupted and resumed at a later time, 
like you are waiting for Guests to arrive. after you mix in the sour cream it should 
be eaten.


Lower the heat, mix in the sour cream, when heated through and bubbly it is time to serve.

serve over rice, garnish with the chopped cilantro.

Enjoy
