Nick's Green Rice

1 bunch of parsley
1/2 bunch of cilantro
1 medium onion
3 cloves of garlic
2 bell peppers
1 1/2+ cups long grain rice
4 tbs  vegetable oil
1/2 tsp salt
2 1/2 or 3 cups of chicken broth


1. In a food processor or blender create a slurry from the onions,
peppers, garlic, parsley, and cilantro, blend until smooth.

2. Toast the rice with the oil, stir constantly .
Add the Slurry, give this mixture a chance to cook in while the rice is browning.

3. Add the broth and salt, mix well, cover and reduce heat to the lowest setting for about 20 - 25 minutes.

Notes:
If the slurry is kind of wet, cut back a 1/4 cup on broth.
Don't just add the slurry, mix it in well while it is browning.
