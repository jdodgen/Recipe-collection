## Instructions

### Brown the pork:
Sprinkle the pork evenly with 1 1/2 teaspoons of fine sea salt. <br>
Heat the vegetable oil in an Instant Pot set to Sauté mode - High (or medium-high heat in a stovetop pressure cooker)
until the oil is shimmering.<br> 
Brown the pork in two or more batches and set aside<br> 

### Sauté the aromatics and toast the spices: 
Add the onions to the pressure cooker pot and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of fine sea salt.<br> 
Sauté the onions until softened, about 5 minutes, scraping occasionally
to release the browned pork bits from the bottom of the pot.<br> 
Stir in the garlic cloves, chipotle en adobo, chili powder, cumin, and oregano.<br> 
Toast the spices until the garlic is fragrant, about one minute.<br>

### Pressure Cook the Pozole: 
Put the pork back into the pressure cooker.<br> 
Add the hominy and diced tomatoes, and stir in the chicken broth or water<br> 
and optional 1 teaspoon of salt if using the homemade broth or water.<br>
Scrape the bottom of the pot one more time, to make sure nothing is sticking.<br>  
Cook at high pressure for 20 minutes in a stovetop pressure cooker, or 24 minutes in an electric pressure cooker.<br> 
Typicaly a "instant pot" on high about 24 Minutes with a natural Pressure Release<br>

### When ready to serve: 
Stir in the lime juice and brown sugar.<br> 

Serve with the accompaniments for people to add to their bowls of pozole. Enjoy!<br>
