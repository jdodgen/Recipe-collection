Verbal recipe given to me (Jim Dodgen) by the chef at "The Swan", Grafton Rd, Wilton SN8 3SS, United Kingdom

broccoli stalks,cut up ("no flowerettes, I use the flowerettes for another dish": The Swan chef)
I used 8 stalks last time (Jim)
1/2 onion, course chopped
1 cup chopped celery 
1 tsp. dried thyme
14oz can of chicken broth
Salt & pepper (white pepper is preferred) 
8 oz. crumbled blue cheese, Stilton preferred
1 cup double cream (US heavy cream)

boil the broccoli, celery and onion in enough water to cover, 
cook until tender
in a blender or food processor purée the broccoli, celery and onion,in small batches 
using some of the chicken broth.

reserve the cooking liquid

return the purée to the pot and thin with the chicken broth and some of the 
reserved liquid, add the thyme, pepper and salt and allow to cook some more to thicken.

Add the Stilton, and melt it in when melted,  finish with the cream.
