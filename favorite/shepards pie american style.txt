"A variation on Alton Brown's highly-regarded Shepherd's Pie recipe" some modifications by Jim Dodgen

I always make half of this using 1 lb ground beef. pretty much cut everthing in 1/2
I tend to go heavier with the "wostersauce" 

Ingredients
3+ lbs potatoes 
1/2 cup milk, or more till mashed potatos seem thin enough
4 ounces butter
1 teaspoon salt, kosher
1/2 teaspoon white pepper

2 tablespoons oil
1 cup onions, chopped
2 carrots, peeled and diced small
3 stalks Celery
2 garlic cloves, mashed
chopped garlic

2 lbs lean ground beef
1 teaspoon salt, kosher
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (or corn starch)
2 teaspoons tomato paste
1 cup chicken broth
2 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon "Kitchen Bouquet" browning & seasoning sauce
2 teaspoons fresh(or dried) thyme, chopped

1 cup frozen corn kernels

Directions
Make the Mashed Potatoes:.

Peel the potatoes and cut into a large dice. Place in pot and cover with cold water. 
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and then reduce heat to a simmer, 
cooking the potatoes until a fork inserted in a potato dice causes it to break apart. 
Drain the potatoes and then return to the pot, adding the milk and butter. 
Mash the potatoes until smooth then season with the salt and pepper. 
Add the (optional, I never use it) egg yolk, stirring until well combined. Put the potatoes in a plastic zip 
top bag to be piped on the top later.

Make the Meat Filling.

(If you are a confident kitchen multi-tasker, you can prepare the meat 
filling while the potatoes are cooking to decrease the total prep time on the meal)
.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
Heat a large saute pan or dutch oven (for a one-pot meal) over medium-high heat. 
Add the oil, allow it to heat for a moment then add the onion, celery and carrots. 
Saute the veggies about four minutes, or until the onions just begin to brown. 
Stir in the crushed garlic, (I just put it in at the begining)

then crumble in the ground beef and stir to brown. 
Cook the meat 3-5 minutes, or until the beef is cooked through.
Season with the salt and pepper, 
then sprinkle on the flour/corn starch, tossing to coat the meat. 

Cook the floured meat for another minute. 
Stir in the tomato paste, chicken broth, Worcestershire sauce, kitchen Bouquet and thyme. 

Allow the mix to come to a boil, stirring to keep the mixture from sticking to 
the bottom of the pot. 
Reduce the heat and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly.

Spread the meat mixture evenly into an 13" by 8" glass baking dish. 
The glass baking dish is prone to boil-overs so set it on a foil- or 
parchment-lined cookie sheet when baking.

Spread the corn on top of the meat mixture 

________________DONT FORGET THE CORN___________________________ 
then 
gently top with the mashed potatoes, Pipe them on from the plastic bag with a end cut off (1/2 inch)
starting at the edges and smoothing the potatoes towards the middle 
of the dish with an offset metal or rubber spatula.

Place the casserole on a rack in the middle of the oven and backed for 25+ minutes, 
or until the potatoes begin to brown. 

Remove to a cooling rack for 15 minutes before serving.
