Eldorado Beef Cheese Cassarole

Mixture #1
1 lb hamburger 
1 15 oz can tomato sauce
  chopped onion (however much you want in your dish)
1 4.25 oz can chopped olives
  garlic powder
  salt 
  pepper
brown hamburger with onions and mix in the above ingredents

Mixture #2
8 oz sour cream 
8 oz cottage cheese
1 4 oz can of chopped mild green chiles (you might want jalepenos)
mix this all up


additional stuff:
crushed "thin" tortilla chips
2 cups shredded Jack cheese or Mexican blend (I use more!)

Now we create the layers:


Half the chips on the bottom of a 9x13 dish (spray Pam in the dish so it doesn't stick)
half the cheese on top of the chips (make sure chips are covered)
all of mixture #1 next
all of mixture #2 next
the other half of the chips
and top it with the rest of the cheese

Cook 30-40 minutes at 350 degrees. (Longer if you like)
