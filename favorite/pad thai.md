```
1-ounce tamarind paste 
3/4 cup boiling water 
2 tablespoons fish sauce 
2 tablespoons palm sugar 
1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar 
6 ounces rice stick noodles 

6 ounces Marinated Tofu/chicken, recipe follows (I use chicken and more like 10 or 12 oz)

1 to 2 tablespoons peanut oil 
1 cup chopped scallions (green onions), divided 
2 teaspoons minced garlic 
2 whole eggs, beaten 
2 teaspoons salted cabbage (I make my own, using some shredded brussel sprouts, salt an vinegar aged for a day)
  or "pickled cassia leaf" which I (jim) think is more authentic. 
1 tablespoon dried shrimp (WTF? I use a bunch of fresh shrimp)
6 ounces bean sprouts, divided 
1/2 cup roasted salted peanuts, chopped, divided 
Freshly ground dried red chili peppers, to taste this is not a hot dish
3+ limes, cut into wedges, decorating the dish
cilantro

Place the tamarind paste in the boiling water and set aside while 
preparing the other ingredients.
 
Combine the fish sauce, palm sugar, and rice wine vinegar in a small bowl and set aside. 

Place the rice stick noodles in a mixing bowl and cover with hot water.
 Set aside while you prepare the remaining ingredients.
 
Once the other ingredients are measured out into separate bowls, 
drain the water from the noodles and set them aside.
 
Cut the tofu/chicken) into 1/2-inch wide strips, similar to French fries. 

Press the tamarind paste through a fine mesh strainer and add to the sauce. Stir to combine. 

Place a wok over high heat. Once hot, add 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil.
 
Heat until it shimmers, then add

	 tofu/chicken
 
Cook the tofu/chicken until golden brown, moving constantly, for no longer than 1 minute.
 
Remove the tofu/chicken from the pan to a small bowl and set aside. 

If necessary, add some more peanut oil to the pan and heat until shimmering. Add 

	2/3 of the scallions
	garlic

cook for 10 to 15 seconds.
 
Add the eggs to the pan; 

once the eggs begin to set up, about 15 to 20 seconds, stir to scramble.

toss chicken/tofu back in
 
Add the remaining ingredients in the following order and toss after each addition: 

	shrimp,  If raw cook a little till they turn color
        noodles, 
	sauce, 
	"cabbage", 	
	2/3 of the bean sprouts 
        and 
	2/3 peanuts.
 
Toss everything until heated through, but no longer than 1 to 2 minutes total. 
Transfer to a serving dish. 
Garnish with the remaining
 
	scallions, 
	bean sprouts (if left), 
	peanuts
        chili peppers?
        and

Marinated Tofu/chicken: 
6 ounces extra-firm tofu/chicken

Wrap the tofu (not chicken, it is OK) firmly in a tea towel. Place the wrapped tofu into an 8-inch cake pan. 
Top with another cake pan and weigh down with a 5-pound weight. 
(Bags of dried beans or grains work well.) Place in refrigerator and press for 12 to 15 hours. 
Place pressed tofu in a 2-cup container. 
Combine soy sauce and five-spice powder and pour over tofu. 
Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes, turning once. 
Remove the tofu from the marinade and use immediately or store in the refrigerator
