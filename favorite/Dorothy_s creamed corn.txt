Dorothy's Creamed corn

Here is the long awaited cream corn recipe.
 
2 pkgs for a total of 20oz Frozen Kernel Corn (30 oz)
8 oz (1/2 pint) Whipping Cream (12 oz)
8 oz (1/2 pint) Milk (12oz)
1 tsp Salt (1 1/2 tsp)
2 Tbsp (heaping) Sugar (3 heaping)
Cayenne Pepper (add to how much bite you would like). I usually use a pinch.

2 Tbsp Melted Butter (3 Tbsp)
2 Tbsp Flour (3 Tbsp)( or corn starch to make it gluten free)
1 cup Parmesan Cheese (1 1/2 cups)
 
 
Combine all ingredients except Butter/Flour & parmesan into a pot and bring to a boil. Simmer 5 minutes. 
Blend butter with flour. Add this to corn and mix well. 
Add 1/2 cup parmesan cheese to corn and mix well. 
Put finished corn in a heat proof casserole, and sprinkle top with 1/2 cup 
parmesan cheese and place under a broiler until evenly browned.
